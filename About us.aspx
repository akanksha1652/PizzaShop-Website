            PIZZASHOP was developed as an easy and affordaable meal for low-income families
Pizza may be an international favourite today but it has its origins as a last resort meal for low-income families in Naples. While pizza today is enjoyed by people across different classes of society, it was a meal reserved for low-income people who were trying to cut back on costs. It was an easy and cheap meal. Families would prepare the dough and top it off with cheese and tomatoes. According to researchers, people thought that tomatoes were poisonous during this period. This was why pizza was reserved for low-income families.

            &nbsp;New York city was home to the first pizzeria in the US New York City is famous for pizza. So- much so, that it has a style of pizza named after it. In fact, the founder of Big Mario’s Pizza, Mario, learned his trade in the pizzerias of New York City. It isn’t surprising that New York’s pizzas are famous. It was the home of the first-ever pizzeria in the US, Lombardi’s. This pizzeria was originally a grocery store before it began selling pizzas in the early 1900s. This set of an explosion of pizza shops in the city.

        <h1 style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bolder;">According to a study carried out by VoucherCodes.co.uk, the average Brit will eat 731 pizzas in their lifetime (or 5,847 slices, to be exact.) The market is therefore booming at around £4.9 billion - with around 6,164 pizza delivery and takeaway places alone. Between pizza takeaway businesses, fast food chains, Italian restaurants, and independent pizzerias, the competition is very tough. So it's up to you to develop a business idea that will allow you to successfully take up your own space on the market.</h1>
