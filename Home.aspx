            Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a 
            usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based 
            dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often 
            various other ingredients, which is then baked at 
            a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired 
            oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta
